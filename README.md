__End-to-End Retail Sales & Customer Analytics with Snowflake, Python, SQL, and Power BI__

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Business Intelligence pipeline for a retail company to gain clear, actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and operational metrics using:

✅Snowflake (cloud data warehouse)

✅Python (data ingestion and automation)
 
✅SQL (Snowflake) (ELT and data modeling)

✅Power BI (interactive dashboards)

__Business Use Case__

Retail businesses often struggle with disconnected data across systems, making it difficult to analyze:

✅Sales revenue trends by region and time

✅Customer purchase patterns by age and loyalty tier

✅Store type and program tier performance

This project builds a scalable BI solution that empowers stakeholders to:
